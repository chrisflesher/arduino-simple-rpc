Ino
^^^

Ino_ is an easy way of working with Arduino hardware from the command line.
Adding libraries is also easy, simply place the library in the ``lib``
subdirectory.


::

    cd lib
    git clone https://github.com/jfjlaros/simpleRPC.git


Host installation
=================

The software is distributed via PyPI_, it can be installed with ``pip``:

::

    pip install arduino-simple-rpc


From source
-----------

The source is hosted on GitHub_, to install the latest development version, use
the following commands.

::
